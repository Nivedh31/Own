Prime Time Again Problem Description Here on earth, our 24-hour day is composed of two parts, each of 12 hours.
Each hour in each part has a corresponding hour in the other part separated by 12 hours: the hour essentially measures the duration since the start of the day part. 
For example, 1 hour in the first part of the day is equivalent to 13, which is 1 hour into the second part of the day.
Now, consider the equivalent hours that are both prime numbers. 
We have 3 such instances for a 24-hour 2-part day: 5~17 7~19 11~23 
Accept two natural numbers D, P >1 corresponding respectively to number of hours per day and number of parts in a day separated by a space.
D should be divisible by P, meaning that the number of hours per part (D/P) should be a natural number. 
Calculate the number of instances of equivalent prime hours. 
Output zero if there is no such instance.
Note that we require each equivalent hour in each part in a day to be a prime number.
